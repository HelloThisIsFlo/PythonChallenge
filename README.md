# PythonChallenge
Solution for the python challenge : http://www.pythonchallenge.com/

## What is it ? 
The python challenge is a website where you must solve enigmas and progress to the next one.
The enigmas themselves are not that hard to solve but to complete them you must write a script. Any language would word, but the site is oriented towards python, and most solution use python libraries.

## Why this repo ? 
Simply for the conveninence of storing a project on Github ^__^.
Please do not check the solutions before trying the puzzle yourself first. It's really fun to do ;)
Note that my solutions are not the most optimised you could find, but they get the job done.

The goal here for me is to be familiar and this website has been great to help progress in this direction ;)
